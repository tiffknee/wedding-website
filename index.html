                <h1>THE STORY OF US</h1>
                <h2>Established in Stuttgart, Germany, since 2018</h2>
                <p>
                  Tiffany is an architectural designer and Steve is a robotics engineer. Both are researchers interested in the intersections of nature and technology. Tiffany develops plant-inspired building components using robot arms, while Steve uses legged robots to investigate how animals move. So they decided to get married.
                  <input type="checkbox" id="toggle-text">
                  <label for="toggle-text"></label>
                  <span class="reveal-text">
                    Tiffany and Steve first met at Herbert'z Espresso Bar, a cozy Swabian cafe popular with the locals, which became a regular haunt for them to while away time over a "Milchkaffee" and "Laugencroissant belegt" as well as to meet with friends (especially Matt and Michelle, who live down the street).<br><br>After exchanging stories of robots, plants, animals, and living across borders, Tiffany bid her goodbye and hurried away (undoubtedly, to attend to some pressing work) and Steve sauntered across town back to his apartment, walked into the living room, and plopped himself upside-down on the couch, gazing at the ceiling, and announced to his flatmate Friedrich "I'm in love!".<br><br>In the next weeks, he plied her with pancakes, boardgames, and open-mic nights (which were in German and unintelligible to the newly arrived expat), culminating in a first official date: a walk through a hillside vineyard to a small Waldgarten for a pay-what-you-want concert from the then-even-less-known Russian guitarist <a href="https://youtu.be/YzgTMh21zhI?si=QXLS9aapY7tio0ob" target="_blank">Alexandr Misko</a>.<br><br>And the rest of the story is still being written…
